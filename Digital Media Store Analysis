# This comprehensive project pertains to a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Display customers who are outside of the US by using != (not equal comparison operator). 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2. Show the customers from Belgium. 
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Belgium";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Denmark. The resulting table should display the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Denmark";

#4. Show the Employees who work as Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Display a distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices;

#6. Show a query that displays the invoices associated with each sales agent and the agent's full name. 
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many invoices were there in 2010? 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

#9. What was the total sales amount for 2010? 
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name and the artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks. Include the Album name, Media type, and Genre as well.
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#13. Display the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp;
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. Find the sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2010.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2010%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
